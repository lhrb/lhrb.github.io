      <description>If you are like me you build side projects from time to time. Some of them are application running on a server. This led me to the question what is a lightweight and simple way to deploy those application. Do I need to setup a full CI/CD pipeline? Well after all these are often heavy tools to run production grade software. Maybe a simple script is good enough for my use-case?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer interested with everything that goes along with software. I enjoy learning about following topics most: Software Design, Programming Language Design, System Design, Lisp (Clojure in particular).
Here I learn to write and collect/share things I learned. I&amp;rsquo;m not a native speaker so pardon me for any mistakes I make.</description>
