<p>In functional programming we emphasize programming with pure functions. A pure function, given the same input,
will always produce the same output without altering any state. Given that we can put the input <code>x</code> and the
computed value <code>y</code> of a pure function <code>fn</code> into a map <code>m = {x y}</code>. Next time someone calls <code>fn(x)</code> we just
go to our lookup. When we are able to do this for all possible inputs we are than able to substitute the calculation
with a lookup in <code>m</code>. Would that be data as code?</p>
