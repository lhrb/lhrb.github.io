      <description>The first sentence on the Wikipedia page about &amp;ldquo;Code as data&amp;rdquo;:
 In computer science, the expressions code as data and data as code refer to the duality between code and data, that allows computers to treat instructions in a programming language as data handled by a running program. [0]
 I strongly associate the phrase &amp;ldquo;data as code&amp;rdquo; with LISP and I absolutely do love to speak about LISP but this time I will try to explore the other way around: &amp;ldquo;code as data&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>If you are like me, you build side projects from time to time. Some of them are application running on a server. This led me to the question what is a lightweight and simple way to deploy those application. Do I need to setup a full CI/CD pipeline? These are often heavy tools to run production grade software. Maybe a simple script is good enough for my use-case? After all, I&amp;rsquo;m most likely to abandon this project after a while.</description>
