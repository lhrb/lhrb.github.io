    <h1>Pure functions? Effects?</h1>

  <section class="post-content"><p>You already sold on the idea using and composing pure functions for &ldquo;calculations&rdquo;
and pushing effects to the edge of your program. While you put a lot of effort in
to internalize these ideas, some of your may never been co-workers exposed to these ideas.
Leaving you with the task explaining it to them. You could either start talking about
all these undeniable benefits or you could help your co-worker to build a mental
model. A very helpful explanation for this, is given by Martin Fowler in his Book
&ldquo;Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&rdquo;. He doesn&rsquo;t speak about pure functions
but still conveys the idea pretty good. So how do we structure and think about the code:
Taking an informal test: can we change the data source? Could we swap out the database
for an XML-File? Can we change out the representation? Could we swap out the web page with
a command line interface? If we can all that what remains are the &ldquo;business logic&rdquo; which we
can compose from pure functions. Data source and presentation are the effects.</p>
